## Happy Valentine's Day!

I made a web app to ask (my now boyfriend) Alex if he would be my valentine! I used **React**, **Vite**, **JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS**, along with **CodeSandbox** to deploy it.

Inspiration taken from [mewtru](https://www.tiktok.com/@mewtru/video/7331103574623096107?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7205114281700165166)'s TikTok channel.

This was a fun project that took me a couple of hours. I added to the original idea by conditionally rendering GIFs and text (via **React Hooks**) based on which button was pressed, changing the "no" statements from being on the no button to a separate line, and doing some personal styling. I also implemented a fun little easter egg (see if you can spot it), and confetti! ðŸŽ‰

Thank you for taking the time to look at my little project - wishing you a Happy Valentine's Day!
